          <p>
            When my daughter Nicole was 11, she complained that her heart hurt.
            Years of escalating symptoms and unanswered questions eventually led
            our family to a functional medicine doctor who identified chronic
            Lyme, co-infections, and mold illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through targeted protocols, Nicole regained her health. Along the
            way, I realized I had to care for myself too, which led me to
            nutrition school and a new understanding of how lifestyle and
            nutrition shape health.

    "What is functional testing?",
    "Functional testing looks at patterns and markers that may add context to your health history. Tests such as GI-MAP and DUTCH are interpreted alongside your symptoms and goals.",
  ],
  [
    "How long does it take to see results?",
    "Timelines vary with your health history, the complexity of your concerns, and how recommendations fit your life. Progress is reviewed and the plan is adjusted over time.",
  ],
  [
    "Do I need to follow a restrictive diet?",
    "The focus is on sustainable nourishment, not blanket restriction. Recommendations are personalized to your findings, preferences, and practical needs.",
  ],
  [
    "What if I have already tried many approaches?",
    "Your history matters. The process begins by reviewing what you have tried, what helped, and where questions remain before recommending a next step.",
  ],
  [
    "How much do supplements cost?",
    "Costs depend on individual needs. Recommendations are prioritized and discussed with your budget in mind; supplements are never treated as one-size-fits-all.",

  [
    "Do you work with people outside Texas?",
    "Yes. Virtual consultations are available nationwide, and eligible functional lab testing can be completed from home in the United States.",

    "What happens after the initial program?",
    "Some clients transition to periodic maintenance check-ins, while others feel equipped to continue independently. The next step depends on your progress and preferences.",

    "Is functional nutrition covered by insurance?",
    "Services are typically self-pay. Some HSA or FSA plans may reimburse eligible testing; clients can request detailed receipts for their records.",
